| Bio | 10 | Having a bio description |
| Location | 5 | Adding your location |
| Website | 5 | Adding a blog/website |
| Social Media | 5 | Twitter/social links |
| Company | 5 | Company affiliation |
| Public Repos | up to 30 | 2 points per repo (max 15 repos) |
| Followers | up to 20 | 1 point per follower |
| Repos with Descriptions | up to 15 | Well-documented repositories |
| Starred Repos | up to 10 | Repositories with community stars |

**Maximum Score**: 100 points

## üí° Suggestions Categories

- Create more public repositories

### üü° Medium Priority
- Add location
- Add website/blog
- Pin best repositories
- Engage with the community

### üü¢ Low Priority

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Structure
- **CSS3** - Styling with gradients and animations
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - Logic and GitHub API integration
- **GitHub REST API** - Fetching user and repository data

## üìÅ Project Structure

```
github-profile-analyzer/
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Main HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md          # This file
```

## üîß Customization

### Changing Colors

Edit the CSS gradient in the `<style>` section:

```css
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
```

### Adding New Suggestions

Add logic in the `generateSuggestions()` function:

```javascript
if (yourCondition) {
    suggestions.push({
        icon: 'üéØ',
        title: 'Your Suggestion Title',
        description: 'Your suggestion description',
        priority: 'high' // or 'medium' or 'low'
    });
}
```

### Modifying Score Calculation

Edit the `calculateProfileScore()` function to adjust point values.

## üö® API Rate Limiting

GitHub API has rate limits:
- **Unauthenticated requests**: 60 requests per hour
- **Authenticated requests**: 5,000 requests per hour

For heavy usage, consider adding GitHub authentication:

```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://api.github.com/users/${username}', {
    headers: {
        'Authorization': 'token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN'
    }
});
```

## ü§ù Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
